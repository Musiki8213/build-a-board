                <p>
                  The power supply slot is used for providing the electric
                  supply<br />
                  to the computer system so that it can start and perform its
                  functions.<br />
                  The total power supply given to the system is around 110 ac
                  power.<br />
                  In the power supply type connector, there are a total of
                  20-pins that<br />
                  are used to maintain the power supply to the computer system.

                <p>
                  CPU means ‘Central Processing Unit’. This is the place of
                  computer<br />
                  data handling. Moreover, it does all the data manipulation,
                  calculations<br />
                  and formatting data for output. Hence, whenever someone
                  buys<br />
                  a computer, he/she becomes more conscious about the CPU<br />
                  and its capabilities.The execution of the instructions within
                  <br />the computer system is very fast. It measures it in
                  cycles of <br />time and refers it to as megahertz. That’s why
                  the ‘MHz’ of<br />
                  a computer’s processor is sometimes referred to as the clock
                  speed.<br />
                  Think about CPUs (and aligned circuitry) beating like a
                  heart,<br />
                  this pulsing/beating is expressed as “MHz” e.g., 2000Mhz.

                <h3>RAM(Random Access Memory)</h3>
                <p>
                  It is a temporary notepad where your computer sends
                  information<br />
                  to disk, or to the storage place of instructions from other
                  input devices.<br />
                  The term “random access” indicates that memory locations in
                  RAM <br />are accessible in any order unlike sequential access
                  of a data cassette tape.

                <h3>ROM(Read-only memory)</h3>
                <p>
                  Read-only memory (ROM) is used to store data that controls<br />
                  the most basic computer functionality, such as starting up,<br />
                  detecting peripherals and operating the computer fan. As<br />
                  the name suggests, the data cannot be edited by the system<br />
                  or users and, unlike RAM, the data stays recorded even when<br />
                  the computer is off. Like hard drives and flash memory, ROM<br />
                  is an example of non-volatile memory -- meaning that it
                  remains<br />
                  in place when the power is off -- while RAM is considered
                  volatile memory.

                  motherboard.<br />
                  The CMOS battery is also capable of storing the time and data

                <p>
                  Your computer’s hard disk drive is like an audio CD that you
                  possess at home<br />
                  except your computer can read and write to it. In other words,
                  your computer<br />
                  can take data from your hard drive (to process it in the CPU
                  or place it in RAM to work with).<br />
                  Also, it can record the results of the work it does back to
                  the disk, which is “writing to disk”.<br />
                  The abbreviation HDD stands for “hard disk drive”. If you open
                  your HDD, you would find<br />
                  a pancake stack on double-sided disks.
